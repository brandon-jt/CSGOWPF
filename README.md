The user chooses a map they want to learn about and can switch between viewing callouts for the map and seeing how to position themselves for a certain grenade throw. I mainly started this project to learn more about WPF and how to handle switching through multiple windows without slowing the program down, as well as getting familiar with XAML and all the customization options, which I believe I have accomplished.
